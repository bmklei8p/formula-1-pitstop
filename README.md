## Project Description


## To Do:
#
6/26/23 - When I open the sidebar, I want the title and logo to be centered above the sidebar - Completed 6/27
#
6/26/23 - The links should have a box or line to denote spacing between them on desktop
#
6/26/23 - The entire div (logo, link title, and whitespace to the right) should all have an onClick to the link instead of just the Link tag - Completed 6/27
